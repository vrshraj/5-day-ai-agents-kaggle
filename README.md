### 🌍 **About This Repository**

This repository documents my complete journey through the **Kaggle 5-Day AI Agents Course**, where I’m learning to design and build **intelligent, reasoning-based AI Agents** powered by **Gemini**, **ADK (Agent Developer Kit)**, and **LangChain**.

The goal of this repo is simple — to connect *theory from research papers* with *practical projects*, exploring how agents **think, reason, and act** using modern AI tools.

---

### 🧭 **Learning Objectives**

- Understand what **AI Agents** are and how they differ from traditional ML models.  
- Explore **Tool Use**, **Reasoning Loops**, and **Memory** in agents.  
- Experiment with **Gemini + ADK** for building and orchestrating agentic workflows.  
- Integrate **Embeddings, Vector Databases, and RAG pipelines** for grounded reasoning.  
- Complete Kaggle’s **Capstone Project** — building a full agent pipeline.
